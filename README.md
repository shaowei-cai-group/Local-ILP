# Local-ILP
A standalone local search solver for general integer linear programming

# How to Use
In order to run Local-ILP, you need to give the path to the input file (in MPS format), and the cutoff time (in seconds).
```
cd bin
./Local-ILP  --instance=<input_file_name.mps> --cutoff=<cutoff_time>
```
