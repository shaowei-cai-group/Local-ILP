# Local-ILP
A standalone local search solver for general integer linear programming

# How to Use
In order to run Local-ILP, you need to give the path to the input file (in MPS format), the cutoff time (in seconds), and the path to the solution file.
```
cd bin
./Local-ILP <input_file_name.mps> <cutoff_time> <solution_file.sol>
```
